#Fireback
Fireback is a web framework to build fast and easy large node.js based applications.
It's designed to use REST or GraphQL API on the backend and offers React and plain JS on the frontend. It can be used
as an API to be consumed by a mobile app.
Fireback supports multiple oauth strategies and let's you generate boilerplate code easily.
Works with MongoDB. It let you add quickly new endpoints or new data models to your GraphQL API.
